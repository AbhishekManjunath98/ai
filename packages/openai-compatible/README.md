# AI SDK - OpenAI Compatible Provider

This packge aims to speed and support the implementation of new
OpenAI-compatible providers. The intent is to allow more effective code sharing
across multiple concrete provider implementations.

The primary OpenAI provider is heavier-weight than what this package offers.
