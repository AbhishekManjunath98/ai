# AI SDK - OpenAI Compatible Provider

This provider aims to support a core subset of functionality common to a wide
range of OpenAI compatible LLM providers. The intent is to allow code sharing
across multiple concrete provider implementations.

The primary OpenAI provider is heavier-weight than what this package offers.
